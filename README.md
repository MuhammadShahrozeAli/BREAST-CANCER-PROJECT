# BREAST-CANCER-PROJECT


Hi, let's summarize what we have done in this project.

So in this project, we imported data from U.S. repositories.

We named our columns our features and then put them into a bandos data frame.


We preprocessed our data and remove column.


We also imported the data so that we would know more about how it we used to describe function.

We have uSwitch us such as the main, the maximum, the minimum and the different quantities.


We also created some historians so that we could understand the distribution of the different features


and scatterplot matrix so that we could look for a linear relationship between variables, we then split


our dataset up to up into the training set and test testing validation test.


We implemented some testing parameters we can classify and as we say, and compare their results using

a classification classification report.


Are features of accuracy, overall accuracy, precision, recall and one score and support.


Finally, we built our own sales and explore what it would take to actually get a malignant and winning


classification.


And that is the end of this project.
